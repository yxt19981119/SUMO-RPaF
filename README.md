## RPaF service description

We adopt the RPaF concept from (Fan et al., 2024), which connects a remote suburb and a downtown hub, as illustrated in Figure. Similar layouts have been used in previous studies to study feeder transit systems, e.g., Kim et al. (2019); Kim and Schonfeld (2013). We use this single-hub system to ensure comparability with prior research. In cases of networks with multiple hubs, the proposed models can be utilized to operate separate RPaF services for each hub.
